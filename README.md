# tiny-lambda
clear, clean Lambda workflow in two files!

Sometimes people get over-excited and write dozen and dozens of Serverless Framework YAML files... which take ten minutes to compile and deploy.

It's not always needed. A "Hello World" is a few lines, and takes a few seconds to update!

In my case, probing our Big Professional site's setup was really painful. I could write a tiny probe (e.g. "check this database exists"), edit and deploy and test it in seconds/minutes. Having a rapid high-quality feedback loop is extremely useful to delivering great software.
